# Firestone

A voxel-based circuit simulation game inspired by Minecraft's redstone.

# Goals

- Fun.
- An UI that's easy to start using, but still extremely capable (more complex operations).
- Be beginner-friendly, teach circuits in an incremental way.
- Intuitive tutorials with well-paced challenges.
- Have a powerful simulation engine that allows hobbyists and students to create hardware capable of running KB-long programs.
- Improve upon redstone:
  - Be less annoying, dont't produce unnecessary delays like Minecraft does.
  - Easier to use basic building blocks, allowing you to focus on what's complex.
  - Modular reusable subcircuits.
